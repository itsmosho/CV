I am an ambitious and highly analytical full stack software developer with experience working in Ruby and JavaScript. A graduate of Makers Academy with previous experience within the sales and market research sphere. 

I was drawn to software development as a career because it’s at the centre of everything we do, from phone apps to websites and programs that we take for granted on a daily basis. 

It’s because of this importance that it is used in almost every industry which I feel suits a multipotentialite such as myself. Giving room to explore different interests and industries whilst also suiting my skillset, with the room for continual learning which I enjoy. 
My background in freelance music production has given me the valuable ability to think creatively which I also apply to software development.

I’m currently looking into the uses of A.I in my spare time and how they’re being used to impact different industries and generally improve quality of life.


## Skills

-	**Problem solving** - At Makers, I Designed and built web applications primarily in Ruby and JavaScript, relying heavily on problem solving and attention to detail to do this effectively. Also, as a music producer problem solving was key to deciding themes and complimentary sounds when working with brands such as Football Beyond Borders and WOW HYDRATE creating sync music for their video adverts and content.


- **Time management** - Working as a courier with my own schedule means that time management very important in regards to working at peak hours and picking or declining orders for maxmimum efficiency and hourly rate. It was also imperative when working as a freelance music producer to complete commission-based work such as arranged studio sessions.

-	**Empathy**	- As a music producer, empathy is needed to ensure studio sessions run smoothly and artists feel safe and ready to express themselves. This especially true when working with new clients or liasing with producers from brands who have less experience or expertise in the creative world, but also have valid input on the project.
-	**Quick learner** - In my final project at Makers, I learnt and contributed to building a mobile app in React Native in two weeks without previously knowing the language. And also accessing resources open authorisation using O2auth. My ability to learn was crucial as emphasis was placed on self-led learning at Makers to becoming tech-agnostic and able to learn new languages in very short timeframes.

-	**Great communication skills** - Communicating and working with other producers and artists locally and internationally to create projects, resulting many songs being released, one even receiving over 1.5million views on Youtube. Also as a courier I utilized communication end to end when interacting with customers ensuring great customer service and restaurant employees to ensure food is delivered correctly, Resulting in a 100% customer satisfaction rate in over 200 orders.

-	**Attention to detail** -	Meticulous attention to detail when removing unwanted sonic artifacts from audio recordings – which feels very similar to debugging. Also displayed during my time at Makers as part of a consistent debuggin progress, resulting in building fully functional web and mobile applications.
