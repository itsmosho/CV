about skills education projects experience  interests


I am an ambitious and highly analytical full stack software developer with experience working in Ruby and JavaScript. A graduate of Makers Academy with previous experience within the sales and market research sphere. 
I was drawn to software development as a career because it’s at the centre of everything we do, from phone apps to websites and programs that we take for granted on a daily basis. 
It’s because of this importance that it is used in almost every industry which I feel suits a multipotentialite such as myself. Giving room to explore different interests and industries whilst also suiting my skillset, with the room for continual learning which I enjoy. 
My background in freelance music production has given me the valuable ability to think creatively which I also apply to software development. I’m currently looking into the uses of A.I in my spare time and how they’re being used to impact different industries and generally improve quality of life.
